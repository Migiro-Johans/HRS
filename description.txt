PAYROLL AND LEAVE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

System Description and Technology Stack

Organization: House of Procurement Limited
Target Users: Employees, Heads of Department, Human Resource, Accounts, Management
Current Staff Size: ~50 Employees
Email Platform: Microsoft 365

1. Purpose of the System

The Payroll and Leave Management System is a centralized, secure, web-based platform designed to automate payroll processing, leave administration, and employee information access while ensuring statutory compliance, strong internal controls, and a consistent employee experience.

In addition to payroll and leave, the system will serve as a single source of truth for company policies and departmental Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), ensuring that all staff have controlled, up-to-date access to official organizational guidance.

2. What the System Is Intended to Achieve

The system shall:

Accurately compute monthly payroll for all employees

Apply all statutory deductions in line with Kenyan law, including:

PAYE

Social Health Authority (SHA)

NSSF

Affordable Housing Levy

Support organization-specific deductions and benefits

Enforce a role-based payroll approval workflow:

Accounts prepares payroll

Human Resource reviews and approves

Final approval by Management / Group CEO (where applicable)

Generate a bank-compatible payroll file for salary payments

Produce secure, auditable payroll records

2.2 Employee Self-Service Objectives

The system shall empower employees to:

Log in securely using official company email accounts

Access and download:

Monthly payslips

Historical payslips

Annual and on-demand G9 (P9A) tax forms

View leave balances and leave history

Apply for leave electronically and track approval status

Access approved company and departmental policies and SOPs

2.3 Payslips and G9 (P9A) Documentation

The system shall:

Automatically generate monthly payslips after payroll approval

Automatically generate G9 (P9A) forms for every employee

Ensure all payroll documents:

Are stored securely

Carry digital approval stamps and e-signatures

Are traceable and audit-ready

Allow HR and Management digital sign-off on payslips

2.4 Leave Management Objectives

2.5 Company Policies and SOP Management (New Module)

The system shall include a Policies and SOPs module that serves as a centralized document repository with controlled access.

The module shall:

Allow Human Resource and authorized administrators to upload, update, and archive:

Company-wide policies

Department-specific SOPs

Restrict access based on:

Employee department

Role or designation

Present policies and SOPs directly on each user’s dashboard, ensuring:

Employees see only documents relevant to them

Departmental SOPs are clearly separated from company-wide policies

Maintain version control, including:

Document version numbers

Effective dates

Archived previous versions

Log user activity, including:

Document views

Downloads

Acknowledgements (where required)

This ensures consistent communication, compliance, and alignment with organizational standards.

2.6 Governance, Compliance, and Audit

The system shall:

Enforce role-based access control across all modules

Maintain tamper-proof audit logs of:

Payroll preparation and approvals

Leave applications and approvals
